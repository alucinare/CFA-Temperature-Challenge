# CFA-Temperature-Challenge

## Description

Do you use ruby and the terminal? Do you want to know what celsius is in fahrenheit? Do you want it printed out in a lovely table colour coded by temperature value? Well, this terminal script can help you do that!

It's a simple ruby terminal script that allows you to entered values from the terminal for a 7 day period. Once the last value is entered a table is created that displays the temperatures entered in celsius and the conversion into fahrenheit.
